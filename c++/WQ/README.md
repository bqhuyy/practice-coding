- The performance will behave significantly on slow (weak) machines

## OpenCV
- Command:
```
./main_cv
```
- Output
```
naive approach: 12.0306 ms
1st element, last element = 0, 5
my approach: 7.45167 ms
1st element, last element = 0, 5
```

## C++ Data Type
- Command:
```
for i in {1..10}; do echo $i && ./main; done
```
- Output:
```
